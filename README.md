# RetroBox Mini TV

A small retro-style TV built from scratch, around 6 cm wide.

# 1. Enclosure

The body is resin-printed. Getting clean prints was straightforward; getting a **clear lens** wasn’t.  
Fresh resin lenses come out cloudy, so I had to sand and polish them through several grits before buffing them clear. Later on, I switched to having the lenses manufactured in China for consistency.

# 2. Lens Design

The lens shape was modeled to give a slight CRT-style curve, with the main goal of refracting the light from the screen as such that it covers the whole visible display  
Printed lenses needed polishing to actually bend light cleanly. Without the polishing step they stay matte and unusable.

# 3. Electronics

PCBs were designed specifically to fill the internal space with as little wiring as possible.  
Metal buttons were chosen after testing resin and plastic versions — those didn’t feel good or hold up.

# 4. Prototyping

Early prototypes involved hand-wired displays, loose boards, and a lot of checking tolerances before committing to final PCB layouts.

# 5. Packaging

I learned basic laser engraving to make the box designs and cut the foam inserts.  
Simple, clean packaging that holds the device securely.
